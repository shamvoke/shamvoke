### The Inspiration.
To quench my curiosity, I often visit [Github's Explore page](https://github.com/explore) to explore and discover cool projects shared by developers from around the world. It's like a digital treasure hunt, and every so often, I stumble on something that sparks my curiosity.

One day, that 'something' was **[Astray.](https://github.com/wwwtyro/Astray)** A maze game running in the browser, built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Box2dWeb](https://box2d.org/). I played it, loved it, and my first thought was _"This should be on mobile!"_ That spark lit the path for what eventually became **Shamaze3D**

### Playing with code.
I forked the code and began tinkering. My first attempt was adding an on-screen joystick to control the ball. It worked, but something about it felt... clunky _(fixed and covering part of the maze)._

So, I tried something different. <ins>Swipe-based</ins> control. Now you can click anywhere on the screen, hold, and drag in the direction you want the ball to roll. _Like steering with invisible strings._ It feels natural, fluid, and keeps the screen clean so the maze itself takes center stage.

Next, I added game sounds, polished the visuals, tweaked the game physics, and layered in a few extra features like high score and splash screen.

### Enter the maze.
Only one rule: **Find the exit and escape the maze!**

**To control the ball**
- **keyboard** - Use the keys **W**(up),**A**(left),**S**(right) & **D**(down) keys.
- **Game pad** - Use the  arrow keys.
- **Touch screen** - Click and drag (virtual joystick)
It's not timed... but your pride is on the line 😎

### 📦 Tech Stack
- 🕸️ HTML + CSS + JavaScript.
- 🧱 [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering.
- 🌀 [box2d.js](https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js) for physics-based collision detection.

### Fork It, Play It, Break It
The spirit of open source is experimentation. You can play Shamaze3D right now in your browser, and if you're feeling adventurous, grab the code and twist it into your own creation.
