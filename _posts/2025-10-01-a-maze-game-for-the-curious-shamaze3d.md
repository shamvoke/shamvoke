### The Inspiration.

To quench my curiosity, I often visit [Github's Explore page](https://github.com/explore) to explore and discover cool projects shared by developers from around the world. It's like a digital treasure hunt, and every so often, I stumble on something that sparks my curiosity.

One day, that 'something' was **[Astray.](https://github.com/wwwtyro/Astray)** A maze game running in the browser, built with [Three.js](https://threejs.org/) and [Box2dWeb](https://box2d.org/). I played it, loved it, and my first thought was *"This should be on mobile!"* That spark lit the path for what eventually became **Shamaze3D**

### Playing with code.

I forked the code and began tinkering. My first attempt was adding an on-screen joystick to control the ball. It worked, but something about it felt... clunky *(fixed and covering part of the maze).*

So, I tried something different. <ins>Swipe-based</ins> control. Now you can click anywhere on the screen and drag in the direction you want the ball to roll. *Like steering with invisible strings.* It feels natural, fluid, and keeps the screen clean so the maze itself takes center stage.

Next, I added game sounds, polished the visuals, tweaked the game physics, and layered in a few extra features like high score and a splash screen.

### Enter the maze.

Only one rule: **Find the exit and escape the maze!**

**To control the ball**

* **keyboard** - Use the keys **W**(up),**A**(left),**S**(right) & **D**(down) keys.
* **Game pad** - Use the  arrow keys.
* **Touch screen** - Click and drag (virtual joystick)

It's not timed... but your pride is on the line üòé

### üì¶ Tech Stack

* üï∏Ô∏è HTML + CSS + JavaScript.
* üß± [three.js](https://threejs.org/) for 3D rendering.
* üåÄ [box2d.js](https://github.com/kripken/box2d.js) for physics-based collision detection.
