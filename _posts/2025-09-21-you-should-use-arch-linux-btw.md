Yeah, I know. The old 'I use Arch btw' That seems to annoy everyone. But honestly,  I get it. After using Arch Linux for over 4 years now.

### Windows.
See, years ago, I was a Windows user. And not your normal user, I considered myself a **power user**. Well, I loved my OS. Digging into *nearly* every Windows feature. Started customizing my own installation, someone would notice and request that I do similar customization on their pc. Even got paid a couple of times to do such setups.

### TouTube
Created a YouTube channel and started uploading my custom edits, so much love. My [make your Windows OS look like Mac OS](https://youtu.be/VCNGyRawkss?si=_cPN9RkEimKFdI5a) video got a **million views!** 

The customizations were fire, but... It didn't take long to notice that the extra software installed for the customization would **bloat the system**. Way too extra. Some, like [Rainmeter](https://www.rainmeter.net/), had to always be running! Noticed a similar trend in the comment section "*How do I undo this?*", "*How to uninstall?*" 

### First switch
At this point, I personally stopped using any customization that required extra software _( turns out, not much)_ 

And for my audience? To avoid more bloated systems, I decided to change the content I was uploading. And my next stop for content was the software I was using,  videos like "how to install software ABC", "how to install Windows 11"

**The problem?** As a power user, every software I had installed was premium. _And none were paid for..._

> For this, you don't even need to be a super user; Just download your cracked copy, disable your anti-virus? Read and follow the instructions in README.txt, and you are done.

The new content was an instant hit, amassing views like crazy. At this point, <del>your boy should be heading to the bank</del>😅 However, YouTube was ready to teach me a lesson I hadn't learned yet... 

### Aye, Pirate.
Copyright strikes, left, right, and center. What could be the issue YT? Turns out using a cracked version of any software is against their community guidelines. I have to agree with YouTube on this one, **pay the developer!**

### Cracked software.
My thinking **at the time** was, since I can't afford the software... and the developer getting paid was the least of my concern, then there is no harm in using a cracked version, right?

### That's when it hit me. 
If someone is smart enough to __remove__ the code that bills you to use a software,  rest assured, they are smart enough to **add** code for their <u>own interest</u>.

> I wasn't just using cracked software, I was running a cracked version of Windows 10 itself, with a full suite of cracked tools stacked on top.

Too many smart people **had access** to my system!

### Second switch.
The message was loud and clear: I had to switch my content again!

My last 3 uploads on YouTube (5 years ago) were my attempt to give my audience clean content.

Letting the designer in me shine with videos like **"Windows 11 concept"** _(Windows 11 hadn't been released at the time)_ 

The videos were '<u>UI designs</u>' of how I envisioned Windows 11 would look like. By the time Windows 11 got released, I had **already moved to Linux!**

### Sham goes Linux

For the 5 years I have used Linux, almost a year was spent switching from one Linux distro to the next. I later learned this is called **"Distro hopping"**

All that changed the day I installed [Arch Linux!](https://archlinux.org)

> I opened a YouTube channel for Windows, but for Arch? I swear I'm about to open a church and start preaching arch Linux 🤣

With that said,  expect most of my future blogs and YouTube posts to revolve around Arch Linux. Plus, the awesome free & open-source software I have picked up along the way.

**I USE ARCH, BTW**

Stay Curious,

Sham.
