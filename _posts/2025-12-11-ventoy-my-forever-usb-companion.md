title: Ventoy, My Forever USB Companion.
subtitle: 🌀 The title for this post should be - My Top 5 must have ISO images
description: Gone are the days of reformatting your flash drive every time you
  wanted to try a new OS. I used to rely on Rufus and balenaEtcher until I found
  Ventoy. Here is how this tiny utility became my forever USB companion, along
  with my top five most essential ISOs.

There was a time when flashing an ISO felt like a whole ritual. Back on Windows, [Rufus](https://rufus.ie/en/) was my trusty sidekick. When I switched to Arch Linux, [balenaEtcher](https://etcher.balena.io/) took over the job. Both did what they promised, but the moment I discovered [Ventoy](https://www.ventoy.net/), everything changed. I ditched them instantly, almost dramatically, the way you uninstall a heavy app after discovering a tiny CLI tool that does the same job better.

Ventoy is <ins>ridiculously simple</ins> and <ins>weirdly brilliant</ins>. You install it once on a USB flash drive, and that flash drive becomes your <ins>bootable buddy</ins>. Instead of burning ISOs, you just copy them into the drive like normal files. Then, when booting your pc, hit the magic key to boot from the Ventoy  USB flash drive. Ventoy scans the drive and shows you a list of all the ISOs inside. Pick one, Ventoy boots it, done. Nothing gets overwritten, nothing gets “flashed” again, and the drive never complains.

>It feels like cheating, but in a good way.

Now that Ventoy lives rent-free on my desktop, I've ended up with a personal lineup of ISO Images that never leave my Ventoy USB stick. The ones I rely on, whenever curiosity hits or when I decide my current OS setup deserves a fresh reincarnation.

### 1. GParted ISO, My Ritual Cleanser.
I usually use this to give my drive a clean wipe before any OS install. Sure, OS installers will wipe the disk automatically, but using [**GParted**](https://gparted.org/) gives me control over everything. GPT? MBR? new partition table? all in my power. It's my must-have.

### 2. Arch Linux ISO, Monthly Candy
Then there's [**Arch Linux**](https://archlinux.org/). The Arch team releases a new ISO on the first day of every month! I always grab the latest one. Arch is my curiosity hub. Sometimes I reinstall to try a new setup, sometimes for a cleaner slate, sometimes just because something in me says, "let's see what happens". I used to reinstall weekly. Nowadays, I surprise myself by running a system for a whole month before the itch kicks in. Progress, kind of.

### 3. Windows 11 ISO. 
I may be an Arch citizen now, but I still keep **Windows 11** as a backup reality. Sometimes I need a <abbr title="Virtual Machine">VM</abbr>, sometimes I help someone with a Windows issue, sometimes I just want a peek at what's new. The ISO lives on my Ventoy stick quietly, updated enough to be helpful, not enough to get clingy.

### 4. Kali Linux Live Everything ISO, Curiosity Playground
The monstrous **13GB+** [Kali Linux Everything](https://www.kali.org/get-kali/#kali-installer-images) image earns its spot purely through vibes and curiosity. In my early days, I used it for WiFi <del>hacking</del> testing, usually with the preinstalled _wifite_ tool. The success rate was… **impressive**. Nowadays, I boot into Kali mostly to explore the massive collection of tools that come preinstalled. It's the perfect OS for curious souls who enjoy pressing buttons that come with warnings.

### 5. The Rotating Fifth ISO
Sometimes I add a temporary guest. It could be a distro I'm testing, a tool-specific ISO, or something random I stumbled on at 2 am. A favorite one for me is [**Linux Mint**](https://linuxmint.com/), a distro I boot every so often just to admire how smooth and friendly it is. But it never becomes a permanent resident on my Ventoy stick.

## Why Ventoy Wins

Because it removes friction. No burning, no re-flashing, no drama. Copy. Boot. Explore. Repeat.

For someone who loves tinkering, switching systems, or simply indulging curiosity, Ventoy isn't just convenient; it's freeing.

If you play around with operating systems as much as I do, prepare to fall in love with it too. The tiny tool changed my workflow for good.

Stay curious,

Sham.
