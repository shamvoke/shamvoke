### If the shoe fits, wear it...

For me, that shoe has always been the 'tech guy' shoe. The one who's called whenever a gadget acts up. A friend will call in panic, their laptop is 'dead', and suddenly I am tech support.

#### First, let me tell you shamthing!

> Whenever I get called for a dead laptop, my first question is usually, "Did it commit suicide?" - *All pun intended, for devices that died on their own.* 

Funny enough, I recall my first request to repair a laptop was way before I even owned one myself. So yeah, the shoes fit, although they were definitely oversized when I first stepped into them. ðŸ˜…

What I find even funnier is the fact that I end up fixing most of those devices anyway. Computers, phones, you name it. So much success rate that I would have easily switched careers, were it not for the fact that usually, it's expected that I fix stuff for free.

#### Shamthing else.

> Of course, I have to admit the said friends have skills I can only admire. I just happen to have a knack for troubleshooting.

### Shoes off.

There was this one time I agreed to do a simple iPhone battery replacement for a friend. Easy, right? Swap the battery, screw it back together, good as new.

Except, somewhere between step one and done, I managed to tear the display cable clean off. Suddenly, what started as a free favor turned into me hunting for a replacement screen... lesson learned, at a cost.

That was the day I almost hung up the tech guy's shoes for good. Well, almost.

### The call.

Earlier last week, I got the tech support call. On the other end? a friend in distress and a laptop that had officially given up on life. Sticking to my usual bit, I asked "So, did it commit suicide?" He laughed, then admitted he had no idea what went down. According to him, it was perfectly fine the last time he used it, but now it just wouldn't boot up, as if it decided to quit without notice.

### The beeps.

He had the laptop delivered to me. I plug it in, press the power button, the fan spins, but the screen never lights up. Meanwhile, the laptop is beeping like crazy! Beep, beep... pause... beep... beep. That could only mean one thing: **Hardware issue.**

At this point, I didn't even bother to investigate which piece of hardware was acting up. **No** way I was opening this <del>one million dollar</del> laptop up. So I decided to take it back, with a solid advice *"Issue is a faulty hardware, take it to a repair shop"*

### Curiosity.

He seemed genuinely curious about how I figured out it was a faulty hardware without opening it up. So, I told him about the beeps.

> You see, the beeps are not just random noises. It's the laptop's version of Morse code... a pattern of long and short beeps.  And each pattern actually translates to a specific error message. In other words, the laptop was talking.

I even joked, "If you listen carefully, it's practically yelling its problem at you." 
He didn't look entirely convinced, but he nodded. We parted ways, and honestly, I wasn't sure he'd follow through. 

### The Fix!

Later that evening, my phone rang. It was him, sounding excited, too excited.

Turns out, he had carefully noted the pattern of beeps, then fed the description to ChatGPT. The AI asked for his laptop's model, and just like that, it decoded the mystery: **Faulty RAM stick!**

He followed the instructions to remove and clean it, reinstalled the RAM, hit the power button... and his beloved laptop roared back to life. Smooth as butter.

At this point, bro was flexing his new pair of tech guy shoes. And honestly, I couldn't have been prouder.

### Why This Matters.

Sure, beep codes are old-school. They've been around since the early days of PCs. To seasoned techies, this isn't new knowledge. But here's the thing: *most regular users have no idea* the laptop is literally telling them what's wrong.

> Even if you don't intend to repair yourself, decoding the beep code could save you a lot of stress. At least you'll walk into a repair shop armed with information.

### The Bigger Picture

We live in a world where AI is becoming a bridge between people and technology. You no longer need to memorize every beep code or error message. You just need to be curious enough to **ask the right question**.

For me, this wasn't just about beeps. It was about passing on a piece of knowledge that might ripple outward. Maybe next time, my friend will help someone else, and the cycle continues.

Stay curious,

Sham.
