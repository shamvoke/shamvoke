So, somehow you've landed on this post. whether by chance, curiosity, or because the algorithm gently nudged you my way. Either way, **Welcome.**

I'm Sham, a UI/UX Designer and Web Developer.

### Why Start a Blog in 2025?
When AI is busy spitting out content by the second. Why now?
#### Reason One. The Web Dev In Me.
I've built blogs for clients before. Most didn't last. The longest survived two years, and even that was a battle.
You see, I was using WordPress for the client's convenience.  (Easier to draft, publish, and edit posts)

#### WordPress Plugins.
When it comes to WordPress, you just can't avoid plugins. You need them for almost everything! In my experience, this always leads to a bloated project. Not forgetting that the really good plugins usually come with a price tag.

**Nulled WordPress plugins.**
Getting 'premium' WordPress plugins for free? Not a smart move, I later learned.

#### SEO And Monetization
Next comes monetization, the bloggers' promised land <del>full of milk and honey</del>. But the journey? not so. To get there, you need serious SEO (_search engine optimization_). This one turns into quicksand if you leave clients to handle it on their own, at least from my experience. 

> SEO is like bathing, you can't just do it once and assume you're clean forever.

And now there are new kids on the block named **AEO** (_Answering Engine Optimization_)  & **GEO** (_Generative Engine Optimization_)

- SEO = Ranking top on search engine results. <sub>Like Google</sub>
- AEO = Optimizing so AI can crawl and pull your content for answers. <sub>Google AI search results</sub>
- GEO = Optimizing content to be cited or summarized by AI. <sub>Like ChatGPT</sub>

> Optimizing for SEO, AEO, and GEO requires consistency, patience, and constant upkeep. something most clients don't have the time or skill for.

Add **website maintenance services** and the piling costs become a deal-breaker for most clients.

### My solution?
**Build Smarter, Not Heavier.**
- For blogs, use **Static Site Generator (SSG)** instead of WordPress. I used [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) for this website.
- Host on **GitHub** + **Netlify**. Zero cost, rock solid.
- Domains? I roll with [Spaceship](https://www.spaceship.com) (By Namecheap, solid trust).
- Protection + extras with [cloudflare.](https://www.cloudflare.com/) Currently _testing_ their free email routing with my email shamvoke@webmeka.com.
- Plug in a CMS (Content Management System) so clients can draft, publish, and edit posts with ease.

> Kindly note my cost-cutting approach is tailored for blogs and landing pages. When it comes to e-commerce, scalability is King.

And now, how better to test that out than running my own blog? So here we are. **My very first blog post!** ðŸ˜Œ

#### Reason Two: **Write To Learn, Publish To Share**
I aim to share my perspective, the wins and fails, the hacks that save me time, and the rabbit holes worth falling into. It's my way of leaving a trail, like digital breadcrumbs, for myself and anyone else wandering the same path. 

Stay curious!
  
Sham.
