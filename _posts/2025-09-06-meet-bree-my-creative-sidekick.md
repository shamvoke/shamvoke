Hey there, you've probably seen this blue face around the site or on my socials. You might have even wondered what it is. And no, that's not just a logo.

>That's **Bree**.

More than just a design element. Bree is the official <ins>brand mascot</ins> for **WEBMEKA**, a Creative Design Agency dedicated to bringing fresh energy and unique ideas to every project. 

>Bree is the face of the webmeka team's energy and creativity.

### This is Bree.

But Bree's story doesn't end there. On a personal level, Bree is also my <ins>creative sidekick</ins>, tagging along on my creative journey.

### What's next
And now, taking things a step further. Plans are underway to make Bree even smarter by integrating **Artificial Intelligence**. The goal is to evolve from a static mascot into a dynamic, interactive presence.

Stay curious,

Sham.
