Hey there, you've probably seen this blue face around the site or on my socials. You might have even wondered what it is.  And no, that's not just a logo.

>That's **Bree**.

More than just a design element. Bree is the official <ins>brand mascot</ins> for **WEBMEKA**, a Creative Design Agency dedicated to bringing fresh energy and unique ideas to every project. Bree is the face of our team's energy and creativity.

But Bree's story doesn't end there. On a personal level, Bree is also my <ins>creative sidekick</ins>, tagging along on my wildest ideas and late night design/code sessions.

### Whats next
And now, taking things a step further. Plans are underway to make Bree even smarter by integrating **Artificial Intelligence**. The goal is to evolve from a static mascot into a dynamic, interactive presence.

Stay curious,

Sham.
