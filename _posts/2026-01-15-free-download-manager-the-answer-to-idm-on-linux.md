After switching from **Windows** to **Arch Linux,** I quickly learned that changing an operating system also means changing your software habits. Leaving behind the apps you relied on for years, including your favorites!

For me, one of those favorites was Internet Download Manager (IDM).

<abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM</abbr> is one of those rare Windows tools that actually earns its reputation. It is fast, reliable, and brutally efficient at grabbing files and videos from the web. 

So when I switched to Arch Linux, I needed a real <abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM</abbr> replacement. Not a toy. Not a half-baked script. Something solid.

That sent me fishing in the open source ocean.

What I pulled out was **Free Download Manager** (FDM). 
### Why Free Download Manager
<abbr title="Free Download Manager">FDM</abbr> immediately ticks an important box, it is **free**. Not trial-free. Not free with limitations. Actually free. Free as in freedom.

And unlike <abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM</abbr>, it's **cross-platform!** Available for Windows, macOS, Linux, and even Android!

Lastly, It is **open source!** 

### Download speed, the honest comparison
Let Sham be real. <abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM</abbr> is still the speed king. 🙌

<abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM</abbr> uses aggressive file segmentation and connection handling, and on Windows, it squeezes every drop of bandwidth out of your connection. In a straight race, <abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM</abbr> wins fair and square.

That said, <abbr title="Free Download Manager">FDM</abbr> is NOT slow. Not even close.

On most downloads, <abbr title="Free Download Manager">FDM</abbr> delivers speeds that are surprisingly comparable to <abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM</abbr>. In real-world usage, the difference is often noticeable only if you are watching the numbers like a hawk. For normal downloading, it feels fast, stable, and reliable.

<small>Let me tell you shamthing.</small>
>I have this habit of 'hawk' watching my downloads, so much so that at this point I list it as one of my hobbies! Anybody else?

**Download resume** support works well. Interrupted downloads come back to life without drama. Browser integration does its job. For a free and open source tool, this is impressive.

#### Where Free Download Manager quietly wins
This is where the story gets interesting. *You thought I was done, uh?*

See, unlike <abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM</abbr>, <abbr title="Free Download Manager">FDM</abbr> can **download torrents**. And it does a great job at that.

That single feature changes everything. No need for a separate torrent client. No context switching. One tool handles direct downloads, magnet links, and torrent files in one place.

There is also **remote connection** support, which lets you initiate and manage downloads remotely. That feels very future-friendly, especially if you run multiple machines or like starting downloads from your phone.

### The licensing reality
This part matters more than people admit.

Paid software deserves payment. Developers deserve to eat. But take <abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM</abbr> for an example, what happens if you switch OS after purchasing that license? Friction! With <abbr title="Free Download Manager">FDM</abbr>, that friction disappears. No license keys. No trial timers. No moral gymnastics around cracked software.
Just install and use.

That peace of mind is worth a lot.
#### Final thoughts
If you are on Windows and raw download speed is your religion, <abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM</abbr> is still hard to beat.
But if you value open source software, cross-platform freedom, torrent support, and a clean conscience, Free Download Manager is an excellent alternative. 

For me, after moving to Arch Linux, <abbr title="Free Download Manager">FDM</abbr> did not just fill <abbr title="Internet Download Manager">IDM's</abbr> shoes. It brought its own pair!
